## Kibo

Kibo (希望) the Japanese word for hope (according to Google Translate, I don't speak Japanese) is a simple wish list application built using [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com). Kibo is very much a work in progress but feel free to fork it, learn from it or contribute back. A working version of it can be found at http://kibo.meteor.com.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tristanoneil/kibo.git
cd kibo
meteor
```
